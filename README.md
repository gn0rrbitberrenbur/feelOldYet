## an algorithmic interpretation of xkcd no. 891

A couple of days I came across this cartoon:

![xkcd number 891, wich explains how to make people feel older based on movies](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/movie_ages.png)
> Image is from the XKCD-webcomic. Source: https://xkcd.com/891

I thought it would be funny to have this as an actual program, so I spend (propably too much) some time implementing the "algorithm" in python. I did this mostly as some kind of exercise to become more familiar with python.

# üìí learnings

json files, parsing json in python, loops in python, error handling in python

# ‚ö†Ô∏è disclaimer
I generated the [movies.json](movies.json) file with a llm. I overlooked it a bit but I cannot guarantee for its correctness. so if you want to use it, feel free but maybe try to check it for mistakes.
